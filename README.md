# Personal Manifesto

I encountered the leadership principle from Amazon, and I think it is a very good standard to follow. It keeps me motivational and humble about myself.

## Learn and Be Curious
Learning should be _continuous_, _perpetual_, and _spontaneous_. For me, It is important to never stop learning and always seek ways to improve myself. I am also curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.

## Be Open-Minded
Staying _open_ to new ideas, perspectives, and experiences helps me grow as a person. I learn new things about the world and the people around me while strengthening my ability to communicate with others.

## Be Self-Disciplined
Any goals can be achieved by staying _consistent_, _motivated_, and _focused_. There are unlimited potentials for me to reach the greatest level of my life. I am able to reject instant gratification and pleasure, in favor of something of greater gain, which requires spending effort and time to get it.

## Be Genuinely Supportive
Giving people a hand when they need it is _not_ about getting credits, it is about moving through life making things better. I can learn about myself by seeing how being supportive can make people grow.

## Be Trustworthy
Trust is hard-earned and easily lost. Building a good reputation by being honest and accountable is necessary for both short and long term collaboration relationships with other people. Together, we can do greater things.

## Plan Ahead If Possible
Planning allows me to make decisions after having considered the alternatives, and equip me with a sense of purpose that will empower everything I do.

## Set Goals Along the Way
Life is dynamic, unpredictable, and sometimes difficult. While it is important to have final goals that set the big picture, it is also important to create ‘checkpoints’ along the way that help to ensure that I stay on the right track at all times. 

## Make the Most Out of My Skills
Practice makes perfect. I actively look for challenging problems and act to solve them. When given the chance, I will utilize my skills to _empower_ people in my community.
